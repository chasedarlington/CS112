// The Competition class contains variables to track the following:

// String: Name of the competition, Name of the winning team, Name of the runner-up

// Integer: Year of the competition

// Implement the Team and Competition classes with appropriate constructor, accessor, and mutator methods. 
// In entering data for past competitions, you note that an entry is usually very similar to the previous yearâ€™s entry. 
// To help with the data entry, create a deep copy constructor for the Team class. Test your copy constructor by creating 
// a copy of an existing team object, changing the competition information for the copy, and outputting the data for the 
// original and the copy. The original object should be unchanged if your deep copy constructor is working properly.
