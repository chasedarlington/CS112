// You operate several hot dog stands distributed throughout town. 
// Define a class named HotDogStand that has an instance variable for 
// the hot dog standâ€™s ID number and an instance variable for how many 
// hot dogs the stand has sold that day. Create a constructor that allows 
// a user of the class to initialize both values.

// Also create a method named justSold that increments by one the number of 
// hot dogs the stand has sold. The idea is that this method will be invoked 
// each time the stand sells a hot dog so that you can track the total number 
// of hot dogs sold by the stand. Add another method that returns the number 
// of hot dogs sold.

// Finally, add a static variable that tracks the total number of hot dogs 
// sold by all hot dog stands and a static method that returns the value 
// in this variable.

// Write a main method to test your class with at least three hot dog stands that each sell a variety of hot dogs.
