/*
Prompt: Create a class named Movie that can be used with your video rental business. 
The Movie class should track the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) 
rating (e.g., Rated G, PG-13, R), ID Number, and movie title with appropriate 
accessor and mutator methods. Also create an equals() method that overrides
Objectâ€™s equals() method, where two movies are equal if their ID number is identical. 
Next, create three additional classes named Action, Comedy, and Drama that are 
derived from Movie. Finally, create an overridden method named calcLateFees that 
takes as input the number of days a movie is late and returns the late fee for that movie. 
The default late fee is $2/day. Action movies have a late fee of $3/day, comedies are 
$2.50/day, and dramas are $2/day. Test your classes from a main method.
